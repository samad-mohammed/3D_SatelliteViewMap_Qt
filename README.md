# 3D_SatelliteViewMap_Qt

Developing a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) user interface using MapboxGL in a Qt project. 
This interface showcases advanced features such as Attitude and Vertical Speed meters, offering precise flight control. 
With integrated Arduino and gyrometer technology, we ensure high-precision measurement of pitch, roll, and yaw. 
The project enhances visualization with dynamic 3D satellite views and provides data integration capabilities, delivering a cutting-edge UAV experience
